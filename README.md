# Terminal Fantasy Quest!
This project started out as an educational lab to consolidate the our understanding of passing data around with in java classes.
Not very long into the brief myself and my felow developer decided that we would turn this into a personal project that we could chip away at with the end
vision to turn the fantasy character logic into a multiple choice "Terminal Quest".....that part is yet to take flight but the logic is mostly there.
